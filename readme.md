# Wine Cellar Application (PHP Version) #

The Wine Cellar application is documented [here](http://coenraets.org).

This application provides an example of:

1. Building a complete RESTful API in PHP using the Slim framework.
2. Consuming these services using jQuery

Set Up:

1. Create a MySQL database name "cellar".
2. Execute cellar.sql to create and populate the "wine" table:

	mysql cellar -uroot < cellar.sql

3. Deploy the webapp included in this repository.
4. Open `api/index.php`. In the getConnection() function at the bottom of the page, make sure the connection parameters match your database configuration. 
5. Open `js/main.js` and make sure the rootURL variable matches your deployment configuration.
6. Access the application in your browser. For example: http://localhost/cellar.
